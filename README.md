# 2022 Be(e) Innovative Intern Challenge
## Equitable Access
The internet is an indispensable part of how we live–we use it to access the news, online shop, connect with others, pay our bills, and find our jobs. Yet, 1 in 3 people don’t have access to the internet worldwide and nearly 1 in 4 in the US. The internet has dramatically revolutionized everything we do, especially when it comes to finding and applying to jobs. Nowadays, a stable internet connection is a prerequisite to being employed as most job listings are posted online and expect candidates to apply online. Furthermore, those without access to the internet are effectively locked out of resources that teach marketable skills like coding and are unable to compete for high-paying jobs that require those skills.
